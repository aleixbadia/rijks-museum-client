              <p>
                One of my biggest passions is cooking and having people home
                with whom to enjoy it with a good glass of wine.

                Since a very young age I have always been playing videogames on
                my free time. I'm currently playing the new TBC expansion of WOW classic.

                I have always been into adventures and adrenaline-rush
                activities. Surf trips with a motorhome, skydiving or just
                riding my motorbike on a sunny Sunday are some of my favourite
                ones.
